# Knowledge base agent in the Wumpus world
This is a university project that was undertaken as part of the "Introduction to AI" course.
It implements a knowledge base were facts about the wumpus world can be stored. The agent uses this database to store its observations about the wumpus world and uses the resolution algorithm of the knowledge base to infer new facts from old knowledge.
